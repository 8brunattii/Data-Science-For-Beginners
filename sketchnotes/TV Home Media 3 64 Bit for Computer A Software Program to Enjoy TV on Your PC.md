TV Home Media 3 is a program that allows you to watch TV on your computer using a TV adapter. However, it is not compatible with Windows 10/11 by default. If you want to use TV Home Media 3 on your Windows 10/11 computer, you need to run it in compatibility mode. Here are the steps to do that:
 
**DOWNLOAD ⚡ [https://t.co/AuvwU6feA6](https://t.co/AuvwU6feA6)**


 
1. Download TV Home Media 3 from a reliable source. You can try this link[^1^] or this link[^2^]. Make sure you download the correct version for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
2. Right-click on the TV Home Media 3 icon and choose Properties.
3. When the Properties dialog box appears, go to Compatibility tab and then click on Run Compatibility Troubleshooter button.
4. When you run the Compatibility Troubleshooter, it will try to guess what version of Windows TV Home Media 3 needs to run normally (in this case itâs Windows 7), and then it will try to run it with preferences for Windows 7.
5. If the program works, youâre good to go. If it doesnât, you need to choose the compatible operating system manually.
6. To choose the compatible operating system manually, you have to get back to Compatibility Mode section, select the Run This Program in Compatibility Mode For check box and select the programâs desired Windows version from the drop-down list (In our case that would be Windows 7).
7. Click OK and then try running TV Home Media 3 again to see whether it works.

This method could be applied to any older program that is not compatible with Windows 10/11. Unfortunately, there are a lot of old programs we used to love that are just not compatible with newer versions of Windows operating system. If running TV Home Media 3 in compatibility mode didnât solve your problem, you might want to consider changing your TV adapter and software, to be compatible with Windows 10/11, because it is unlikely that creators of TV Home Media 3 will make it compatible with newer Windows operating systems in the future.
